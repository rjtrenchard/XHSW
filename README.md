XHSW Crosshair switcher
=====

XHSW is a crosshair switcher for Team Fortress 2.
It supports different weapon settings, such as no primary, no secondary, and demoknight modes.

Settings
=====
Edit the files xhsw_settings.cfg, xhsw_settings_spy.cfg, xhsw_settings_nosecondary.cfg, xhsw_settings_demoknight.cfg, and xhsw_settings_engineer.cfg

The file xhsw_settings is executed first, anything you put in the other settings files will overwrite the defaults,
 you can use those files to make some specific colourschemes for whatever class you like.

The other files are made to be as hands-off as possible, You are not required to touch them.

- Spy appends "lastdisguise" to mwheel clicks, as personally I use mouse4/5 for weapon switching. this way you can quickchange your weapon while disguised.
- Demoknight completely disables anything but melee.
