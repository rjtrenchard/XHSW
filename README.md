XHSW Crosshair switcher
=====

XHSW is a crosshair switcher for Team Fortress 2.
It supports different weapon settings, such as no primary, no secondary, and demoknight modes,
It also features a quick toggle for viewmodels (defaults to F).

Settings
=====
Edit the files xhsw_settings.cfg, xhsw_settings_spy.cfg, xhsw_settings_noprimary, xhsw_settings_nosecondary.cfg, xhsw_settings_demoknight.cfg, and xhsw_settings_engineer.cfg

The file xhsw_settings is executed first, anything you put in the other settings files will overwrite the defaults,
 you can use those files to make some specific colourschemes for whatever class you like.

The other files are made to be as hands-off as possible, You are not required to touch them.

- Spy appends "lastdisguise" to mwheel clicks, as personally I use mouse4/5 for weapon switching. this way you can quickchange your weapon while disguised. This can be changed in xhsw_settings_spy.cfg
- Demoknight completely disables anything but melee (DeGroot mode)
- Engineer and Spy profiles exist, although I'd suggest you hotkey your spykit and build/destroy keys anyway.

Installation
=====
To install, copy all cfg files (prepended with xhsw_*) to the tf/cfg/ folder.

TODO
=====
- Weapon switch for numbered key entry (using 1..6 to select your weapon) working with xhsw_lastweapon
- Grapple hook toggle
